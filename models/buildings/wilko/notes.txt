I have a feeling the rainbow logo will date from 1984, when there was a new logo.

C&A closed all branches in the UK between 2000 and 2001

At some point the shop was bought by Wilkinsons. I have a feeling it was empty for a while, but it was not long. There is an image here that shows the logo at least:

In 2014, Wilkinsons rebranded to Wilkos.

Model

The front is a good copy, but the real thing goes back a long way, over 50m, twisting by about 45degrees to the left. The back wall is free-lance. A space above the big door could say "Deliveries", and beside the small door saying "Fire exit do not obstruct"
