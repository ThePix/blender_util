Bridge skew

I am not sure how universal this is, but this is the system at least some people use, and seems the best to me.
Consider the over bridge being horizontal on the map. The angle of skew is how far off the perpendicular the route underneath is. A positive angle indicates it is skewed clockwise.

At bridge that is not skewed therefore has a skew angle of zero.

      comments:'This is a highly configurable bridge that you can adapt to suit what you need. You can have it perpendicular, or you can skew it to the left up to 65 degrees or to the right up to 65 degrees. It was designed for double track, but could readily be used for single or quad.\nThe span is approximately 100 mm (check!). For a large span, buy the extension kit, which includes extra side pieces and three supports. Each additional span adds about 106 mm.\nThe advantage of a lattice bridge, both for modellers and the real thing, is the infrastructure is mostly above rail height. This means you require less height between the rails on the bridge and whatever is below it.\nEach abutment requires a left abutment piece, a right abutment piece and a connecting wall. The two abutment pieces should be positioned so they are parallel to the track, and staggered with repect to each other. The connecting wall then goes between them, at the correct angle. The wall is designed for a double track bridge at an angle of about 65 degrees off the perpendicular (a bridge that is not skewed is perpendicular, the angle is zero). For single track and for smaller ankles, it will need to be cut. Note that it has coping bicks at the top. I would advise cutting the end that will form an obtuse angle with the abutment. Each abutment has a small recess in it to accommodate the connecting wall.',

3rd and 4th radius, 300 and 330 mm
Implies 30 mm clearance
285 mm inside, 345 outside

So need buttresses that are 50 mm and 60 mm widths
Say a span and pier is 38', or 76 mm nominal for 315 radius
The inside length is 76 * 285/315
The outside length is 76 * 345/315
Say the buttress/pier is 15 mm

Double track, 3rd and 4th radius
We have a section 76 mm long
Say this is an angle of A
Triangle hypot is 315, opp is 38
sin A/2 = 38/315
A/2 = 6.93

Single track, 4th radius
We have a section 76 mm long
Say this is an angle of A
Triangle hypot is 330, opp is 38
sin A/2 = 38/315
A/2 = 6.93
