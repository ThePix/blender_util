      comments:'This is a highly configurable bridge that you can adapt to suit what you need. You can have it perpendicular, or you can skew it to the left up to 65 degrees or to the right up to 65 degrees. It was designed for double track, but could readily be used for single or quad.\nThe span is approximately 100 mm (check!). For a large span, buy the extension kit, which includes extra side pieces and three supports. Each additional span adds about 106 mm.\nThe advantage of a lattice bridge, both for modellers and the real thing, is the infrastructure is mostly above rail height. This means you require less height between the rails on the bridge and whatever is below it.\nEach abutment requires a left abutment piece, a right abutment piece and a connecting wall. The two abutment pieces should be positioned so they are parallel to the track, and staggered with repect to each other. The connecting wall then goes between them, at the correct angle. The wall is designed for a double track bridge at an angle of about 65 degrees off the perpendicular (a bridge that is not skewed is perpendicular, the angle is zero). For single track and for smaller ankles, it will need to be cut. Note that it has coping bicks at the top. I would advise cutting the end that will form an obtuse angle with the abutment. Each abutment has a small recess in it to accommodate the connecting wall.',
